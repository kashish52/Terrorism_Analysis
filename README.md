In this repository I give exploratory data analysis of Terrorism in India till 2018.

This Project includes the exploration of the state of terrorism in India from 1965 to 2018. The Analysis is done on the various parameters. And some comclusions and results are proposed in the notebook.


The dataset used for this project is publically available Global Terrorism Database. The link for the same is (https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd). 


After EDA some statistics and machine learning algorithms is applied to the dataset to predict the possible number of casualties with the posible data available at the time of attack. This Prediction is useful to arrange the help for the people accordingly.
